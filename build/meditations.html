            <h1>Meditations</h1>

<p>Inspired by Marcus Aurelius, I&rsquo;ve been continually editing and updating this document as my own personal project dedicated to my understanding and intention towards life. I must preface, it is ridiculously incomplete. What stands below is just what I have gotten around to writing at the time being (with certain sections omitted).</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Inspired by Patrick Collison&rsquo;s question:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why is there no canon for life&rsquo;s most important questions?</strong></p>

<p>If we go to study economics, we quickly become familiar with The Wealth of Nations and Keyne&rsquo;s General Theory. If we become interested in moral philosophy, we swiftly encounter Reasons and Persons and A Theory of Justice. But for many of life&rsquo;s most important questions, we won&rsquo;t find any similar canon. That is, there are no similarly definitive books about how to navigate your education, how to select a career, how to choose a partner, how to be a good friend, or how to raise your children well. That&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t lots of books on these questions. There are, of course. But there are none that are so good, or important, that you might assume that others interested in the questions will be familiar with their ideas. Is it not possible for there to be &ldquo;great&rdquo; books about these questions? Or have they just not been written yet?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Broad Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the meaning of life?</li>
<li>How will you take care of your basic needs?</li>
<li>What will you do with your free time?</li>
<li>What is your definition of success/living well? What kind of life do you want for yourself? Themes? Ideals?</li>
<li>What do you value in yourself?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Axioms</h3>

<p>You are a human</p>

<p>You are an animal, a product of your environment, at the mercy of your biology</p>

<p>Death may happen tomorrow, or it may happen in 100 years</p>

<p>Everything in moderation</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>High school</p>

<p><strong>Social</strong></p>

<p>Get involved in things. I think the most helpful thing you can actively do to make friends is put yourself in situations where you&rsquo;ll regularly see the same people. Your classes are a pretty good form of this. Activities outside of classes are also a really good way of doing this. Even going to the library or the gym on some sort of regular schedule could be a form of this. High school (and college) is a great time for making friends because opportunities to regularly interact with One-off encounters with people have a chance of sparking a long-lasting friendship, but the odds are much lower if you have to make a deliberate effort to see them. These days it seems to be more common to maintain relationships online, but I don&rsquo;t have a ton to say about this because I haven&rsquo;t had a ton of experience with it.</p>

<p>Be friendly, and genuinely curious. It&rsquo;s reasonable to not be interested in every single thing about a person&rsquo;s life, but there&rsquo;s almost always something about a person that you could be interested in. You just have to find it. Asking questions will lead you to uncovering more and more things until you find that something that connects both of you. And if you genuinely ask someone anything about themselves, they&rsquo;re typically receptive and willing to share.</p>

<p>Find excuses to interact with people. Ask about the homework, or thoughts on the teacher, or comment on whatever activity is going on. It&rsquo;s relatively low-risk to just say something—as in it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely someone is going dislike you from a casual remark or question—but it has the possibility of starting a friendship with someone.</p>

<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>

<p>If you have a good sense of your values/priorities, I think it should be no problem.</p>

<p>There are many things to life; try not to get swept away in romance. Or do. It&rsquo;s generally all good life experience for the most part.</p>

<li><p>Parenting</p>

<p>As a parent, you are responsible for bringing a new life into the world. You have close to full agency over the trajectory of their early life, and have the power to influence the foundation for their adulthood and beyond. Most of being a parent is wanting your child&rsquo;s life to go a certain way, and executing/struggling on ways of bringing that to fruition.</p>

<p>On deciding what you want for your child, it is up to you. I would following similar guidelines for organizing your own life - try to express the things you value/find important/your beliefs as clearly as you deem necessary, and constantly reevaluate as you go. Some important questions/topics you may want to consider: What are important things for your child to have/experience? What kind of personality/qualities would you want your child to have? What do you want your child to value/believe? Consider these questions on the levels of different topics like education, work, creativity, relationships, money, society, health, pleasure, pain, nature, politics, etc.</p>

<p>On actually doing the work of influencing your child&rsquo;s life to go a certain way, I think you have certain tools in your arsenal, and there are different stages of a child&rsquo;s life that will determine your ability to use these tools.</p>

<p>The tools: speaking to them, crafting their environment (i.e. the food they eat, access to a device, the internet, books, sports), determining/restricting their activities (friends, travel, manifestations of access to things in their environment)</p>

<p>The stages: birth → childhood, childhood → adolescence, adolescence → early adulthood, early adulthood → adulthood, adulthood → death</p>

<p>On the tools:</p>

<p>A child is a person like anyone else, and you can only influence other people in a limited amount of ways. People have minds of their own, and are for the most part going to do whatever they want. When you have a relationship with a person, they may value your input and perspective, they may even seek you out to influence them in certain ways, so it will give you more ability to influence them, however the bottomline assumption of their independent agency still holds. A child is like this, except you also determine the environment that they live in, and you have certain control over their freedom to do certain things. However, your ability to use these tools fluctuates.</p>

<p>Humans are animals, and they mostly form their worldview and make decisions in their lives based on the things they are exposed to, and so you can have influence over this via crafting their environment growing up. People will not really want to play Diablo 3 if they don&rsquo;t know it exists. They will want to read the second Narnia book if they read and enjoyed the first one. They will probably watch a lot of TikTok or YouTube videos if they are given a mobile device and a lack of things to do. They will probably crave Cheetos pretty often if there&rsquo;s usually a bag in the pantry. They will probably try to play any instruments in the house if they aren&rsquo;t constantly playing video games or consuming media. These are just a short set of examples to provoke a line of thought as to what to consider when crafting your environment in a way to allow them to be naturally exposed to certain things. <strong>At the end, you cannot force your child to become interested in certain things, but you can strategically design their environment as to make it more probable for them to discover it for themselves.</strong></p>

<p>On the stages:</p>

<p>For their early childhood, you have almost full control over their life, their experiences, their environment, everything.</p>

<p>At a certain point, they start having a personality, thoughts/opinions of their own, and you lose just a little bit of that control, but they are still extremely malleable. This is from ages maybe 5-11. Here you still have full control over their environment at home, and what they do after school. School is really the first wildcard - you can only understand so much of what happens at school, the people they will meet, and the influence that this will have on them. Although school will have a significant influence, they will still remain somewhat of a constantly changing  blank slate for a while, and your agency at home will still have the majority role in shaping their lives.</p>

<p>Once they reach adolescence, and they go to high school, they&rsquo;ll spend less and less time with you and at home, and so logically they will be influenced more by their life experiences (in the context of how they&rsquo;ve been raised up to this point) and exposure to different aspects of the world. Their friends will have a large influence on them, yet these are people you have the least control over. You have no idea how your child will make friends, lose friends, take influence from them, or how their friends may change. This is why the previous stages are actually so important, because you will lose control much earlier than it will feel like.</p>

<p>As much as you can restrict them from going out with friends, dating, playing video games, or eating certain things, they will be able to go around you if they really want, and the more you try to control them, the more distanced you and them will probably end up. At this point, I think the most you can do is take interest in their lives, be there for them, and make suggestions to provoke them to think or get exposure to certain things.</p>

<p>You will most likely still have agency over their food, and things they have to buy to get access to, and so you can still influence their environment in that way, but otherwise you are much closer to being a minority influence in their lives.</p>

<p>I must add however, at this point, it is really dependent on your specific relationship with them as to how all of this fits into your parenting.</p>

<p>To be continued..</p></li>

<li><p>Love</p></li>

<li><p>Friends</p></li>

<li><p>Nature</p></li>

<li><p>Health and longevity</p>

<p>Find what works for you.</p>

<p>Get sun exposure. Not too much though. Preferably in morning or evening when there is more red light and UV isn&rsquo;t as strong.</p>

<p>Fast. Intermittent, or longer. Calorie restriction.</p>

<p>Exercise. Have muscle. Be able to do things like a push up and a pull up. Live an active lifestyle. Do some vigorous activity regularly.</p>

<p>Good sleep is mostly a byproduct of a good life. If you live an active lifestyle, if you feel satisfied or fulfilled by your work, relationships, hobbies, etc., if you have eaten well, you will sleep well. Leave enough time for your body to make use of it.</p>

<p>Nothing in excess, everything in moderation. Eat a variety. Avoid processed or refined foods. Generally avoid too much carbohydrates, and if you do eat them, mix with fats and/or fiber. Enjoy good food.</p>

<p>Be happy. Stress will lay waste to all areas of physical and emotional well-being, so just try to enjoy things. Hopefully this doesn&rsquo;t stress you out more, and instead gets you to prioritize your happiness.</p></li>

<li><p>Emotional well-being</p>

<p>On dealing with difficult emotions:</p>

<p>For the most part, focusing on what is in your control and the actions you can take in a situation can give you a direction for actively dealing with most matters of emotional turmoil.</p>

<p>Expressing your thoughts either to a friend, by writing/typing, or through art, can be helpful for processing emotions. It can also be helpful to consume art, literature, conversations, stories, etc. that express what you feel.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just need time to pass. Sometimes you just need to take a break from things and indulge in things you enjoy.</p>

<p>Sometimes if you&rsquo;re feeling lazy, unmotivated, depressed even, taking any sort of action can be a step towards rediscovering your motivation or energy for life again.</p>

<p>Always try to take care of your body, as your biology has a large yet invisible impact on how you feel emotionally.</p>

<p>Having certain disciplines in your life, things that you do very regularly, can help ground you and get you momentum for dealing with or moving past certain emotions.</p>

<p>But even with all the knowledge for dealing with things, it&rsquo;s difficult, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p></li>

<li><p>Productivity</p>

<p>Be time agnostic but time cognisant. Humans are not machines and so you shouldn&rsquo;t expend yourself to stick to a schedule better fitted for an automated system. If you cultivate a mindset and environment conducive to the lifestyle you want to live and the things you want to do, motivation will be natural and frequent. However you live in a society, and must conform to some extent.</p>

<p>Rest liberally.</p>

<p>On working hard. Work efficiently and deeply. Constantly assess your rate of output to check for diminishing returns telling you to switch or rest. Through this you will most likely produce sufficient output while enjoying your work more, and leaving time for the other things in life.</p></li>

<li><p>Finances</p>

<p>Purposes of earning money: meeting your needs, funding pursuits, being generous, freedom</p>

<p>Non-purposes: status, accumulation, competition</p></li>

<li><p>Exploration</p></li>

<li><p>Learning</p>

<p>Consume - get ideas from an external source, preferably written text, otherwise any form of media</p>

<p>Write - practice recalling, organizing, and consolidating ideas you pick up. Think hard and draw connections.</p>

<p>Share - talk to others. They will shed light in ways you never could and you will get experience articulating your thoughts and formulating engaging stories on the fly.</p></li>

<li><p>Abundance</p>

<p>It has become more and more prevalent in my life, particularly because of the privileged background that I&rsquo;ve come from, that a relevant struggle and cause for problems is not scarcity but abundance. Abundance of information, food, opportunities, etc. It sounds like paradise to those fraught with scarcity, but once achieved, you come to realize that it has it&rsquo;s own problems.</p>

<p>In my own life, I&rsquo;ve recently become exhausted by the shear exposure to so much all the time. Notifications, ads, videos, shows, memes, tweets, pictures. It feels like so much just commotion is unwarranted by nature, but it is the way we&rsquo;ve come to live.</p>

<p>Aristotle theorized the golden mean, that the most desirable state is actually near the balance (and actually a balance leaning towards one end), i.e. the maxim &ldquo;nothing in excess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be everywhere is to be nowhere.&rdquo; - Seneca, letters from a stoic</p>

<p>So how do you navigate this world where the default seems to be succumbing to the perils of overconsumption in all forms?? Well first, acknowledgement. Some books that may help understanding it all: Brave New World, Essentialism (I&rsquo;ve only read a bit of each).</p>

<p>Once you acknowledge it, maybe just see what you could go without. I would say try to live on the least possible, and slowly incorporate more as seems comfortable. Then you&rsquo;ll learn what is really necessary, and what you may be consuming as a form of escapism or reactiveness. This applies more to consumption of information, but could also make sense in terms of food, activities, relationships, opportunities. To the extent that I have participated in this process I think it&rsquo;s gone pretty well.</p></li>

<li><p>Society</p>

<p>It feels that often you may know what you want, but aspects of society prevent you from doing those things. Like you technically have the freedom to do them, but it would be very uncomfortable to actually pursue them because of how society views them, or how certain systems would respond to you pursuits.</p>

<p>In a lot of ways, it&rsquo;s not even just society, but tradeoffs in opportunities and your perceived freedom. We are free, but we can&rsquo;t play God just do anything we want.</p></li>
